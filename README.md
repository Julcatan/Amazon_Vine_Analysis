# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This analysis evaluates data related to the Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

In this project, I have analyzed the following dataset containing Jewelery reviews:
